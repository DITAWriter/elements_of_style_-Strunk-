    <title>Rule 13</title>
    <shortdesc>Omit needless words.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph
            no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary
            lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his
            sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but
            that he make every word tell.</p>
        <p>Many expressions in common use violate this principle:</p>

        <p>As positive statement is more concise than negative, and the active voice more concise
            than the passive, many of the examples given under Rules <xref keyref="rule_11"
                >11</xref> and <xref keyref="rule_12">12</xref> illustrate this rule as well.</p>
        <p>A common violation of conciseness is the presentation of a single complex idea, step by
            step, in a series of sentences or independent clauses which might to advantage be
            combined into one.</p>
