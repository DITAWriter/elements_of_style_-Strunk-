# elements_of_style_-Strunk-
A DITA-fied version of Strunk's original _Elements of Style_, derived from an out-of-copyright version published in 1920, made available on Project Gutenberg.

The plan is to produce a version of this of this (early 20th-century) guide to style in DITA 1.3. Ultimately it should showcase:
- how to use a keystore (TBD)
- structuring DITA 1.3 glossaries (TBD)
- serve as an example on how to approach a legacy conversion project (ongoing)

This initial commit is _very_ rough, and there is still much work to do.
